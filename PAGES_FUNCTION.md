## Homepage would just handle Routing and which views to be displayed

## Word of the day is the first page and it contains word of the day lmao

## There is a search page too

-   The Search page contains your search, related words first and then history under and favourites
-   If Search is empty it'll render out favourites then history

## Definition page

-   Contains word info and add words to favourite

? When you click on the the part of speech it pops up a bottom drawer that shows you what that part of speech mean

### TODO

- [ ] In api's add a way to pass in a index as a parameter then the definition from definitions based on index (This can be applied to multiple places)

when user opens the app they should see a word of the day page (which is a new random word each day)
at the top there's a search bar which is in a sliverAppbar and the sliverAppbar title is the word of the day
at the body there's the word of the day in bold text, a text to speech beside it and under there should be definitions about the word, synonyms and word information and example

## FLOW 2
The user press search and they get redirected to a window in a sense which has a search bar and a list of words based on search but if the list of words is empty they would see their "history" [History would have a cancel button beside it]
the search bar would have a search icon side it

## FLOW 3
When the user searches he gets to the third window where they can see all info about word, and also decide to add word to their favourite...

## FLOW 4
Inside the app bar there would be a menu for Get random words (which would get random word), A get word of the day and a favourite word, and for the app bar we'd use that app bar mitch koko showed

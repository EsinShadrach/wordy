Wordy is a mobile application that allows users to search for word definitions, meanings, synonyms, and antonyms. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to look up the meanings of words on the go.
Features

-   Word Search: Users can easily search for words using the search bar at the top of the app. As they type, the app will suggest auto-complete options to help them find the word they're looking for quickly.

-   Word Details: Once a word is selected from the search results, the app will display detailed information about the word, including its definition, pronunciation, example usage, synonyms, and antonyms.

-   Favorites: Users can mark words as favorites by tapping the heart icon next to the word details. Favorite words will be saved locally and can be accessed later for quick reference.

-   History: The app keeps a history of the user's search queries, allowing them to revisit their past searches and easily access previously searched words.

License

The wordy was inspired by the need for a simple and efficient tool to look up word meanings and... that I don't have a dictionary app on my phone ðŸ˜‚. Thanks to the Flutter community for their excellent support and the developers of the open-source packages used in this project.
